> *"Algorithm design meets formal verification"*

## Introduction

This [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) adaptation of [Algorithm Design with Haskell](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/books/adwh/) reinterprets five essential principles of algorithm design—divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, thinning, dynamic programming, and exhaustive search—within a dependently typed setting. All examples are reimplemented in Lean, a functional language and proof assistant based on dependent type theory. More than a translation, this version makes explicit the informal equational reasoning of the original by turning it into fully formal, machine-checked proofs.

The main goals of this adaptation are:

- to demonstrate the expressive power of dependent types in representing and reasoning about algorithms,
- to show how informal proofs can be systematically formalized,
- to explore how different refinements of the same algorithm can be proven equivalent.
- and to explore how to proof termination of functional algorithms.

Along the way, readers gain experience not only in algorithm design, but also in writing correct-by-construction programs and proving their properties rigorously. This book invites students and practitioners to see algorithmics not just as a matter of clever ideas, but also as a foundation for precise, verifiable software.
